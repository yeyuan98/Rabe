Description: Base editors are emerging molecular sensors for protein-RNA 
    interaction. This package implements a workflow for analysis 
    of adenine base editor datasets. With minimal adjustment it can be used 
    for systematic inquiry of any known single base-pair mutagenesis patterns. 
    Part of the y3628 analysis suite.
